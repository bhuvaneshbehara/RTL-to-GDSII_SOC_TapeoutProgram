Welcome to Day 1 of the RTL-to-GDSII SoC Tapeout Program! ðŸŽ‰

```

Today, your journey into VLSI design begins with a deep dive into simulation and synthesis using cutting-edge open-source tools.

ðŸ”¹ Youâ€™ll discover what an open-source simulator is and get hands-on with Icarus Verilog (iverilog) to simulate Verilog RTL designs.

ðŸ”¹ Youâ€™ll learn the fundamentals of logic synthesis, understanding how RTL transforms into gate-level logic.

ðŸ”¹ Finally, youâ€™ll roll up your sleeves and perform practical synthesis with Yosys, an open-source tool trusted by designers worldwide.

This is not just theoryâ€”itâ€™s about real, practical experience. By the end of the day, youâ€™ll have simulated and synthesized your own designs, taking the very first step toward a complete SoC tapeout. The journey starts hereâ€”letâ€™s make it count! ðŸš€âœ¨

## 1. What is a Simulator, Design, and Testbench?

## simulator

A simulator is a software tool that executes a design model along with its testbench to mimic the behavior of a digital circuit. It evaluates how the circuit responds over time by processing the input signals and applying the defined logic of the design.

In the context of Verilog, a Verilog simulator allows designers to:

---> Execute and verify the functionality of a Verilog design.

---> Test the design with a testbench before moving to actual hardware implementation.

---> Observe and debug the circuitâ€™s behavior in a safe, virtual environment.

In short, a simulator helps validate the correctness of a design at the RTL (Register Transfer Level) before it progresses to synthesis and physical design, saving both time and cost.


## Design

A design in Verilog is the hardware description (RTL code) that specifies how a digital circuit should work. It defines the structure and behavior of the circuit using modules, inputs, outputs, and logic.

## Testbench

A test bench is a simulation-only environment written in a Hardware Verification Language (HVL) like Verilog or SystemVerilog that applies input stimuli to a Design Under Test (DUT) and checks its output responses to verify the design's functional correctness.

## 2. Introduction to iverilog based flow


Here is an explanation of the iverilog-based simulation flow

* **Design & Test Bench:** The simulation process starts with two main inputs: the **design** (your Verilog code for the circuit you're creating) and the **test bench** (another Verilog module that generates input stimuli and checks the output of your design).
* **Icarus Verilog (iverilog):** These two files are compiled together by the **iverilog** compiler. Icarus Verilog is a free and open-source Verilog simulator. It takes the design and test bench files and creates a simulation executable.
* **VCD File Generation:** During the simulation, the iverilog executable generates a **VCD (Value Change Dump) file**. This file records all the signal changes over time in your simulation. It's a text-based format that logs when and to what value a signal changes.
* **GTKWave:** The VCD file, being a raw text log, isn't easy to read. You use a waveform viewer like **GTKWave** to open and visualize the data from the VCD file. GTKWave presents the signal changes as a graphical **waveform**, allowing you to see the timing relationships and values of all the signals in your design. * **Waveform Visualization:** The final output is the waveform display in GTKWave, which is crucial for debugging and verifying that your design behaves as expected according to the test bench stimuli.

Hereâ€™s the typical simulation flow image:

## 3. Setup the environment 


###  Step 1: Clone the Repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop.git
cd sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files
```

###  Step 2: Install Required Tools

```shell
sudo apt install iverilog
sudo apt install gtkwave
```


# 4. How to use GTKWave and Iverilog with a 2-to-1 Multiplexer example 

Letâ€™s simulate a simple **2-to-1 multiplexer** using iverilog!


###  Step 1: Simulate the Design

Compile the design and testbench:

```shell
iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v
```


Run the simulation:

```shell
./a.out
```

View the waveform:

```shell
gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd
```


## 4. Verilog Code Analysis

**The code for the multiplexer (`good_mux.v`):**

```verilog
module good_mux (input i0, input i1, input sel, output reg y);
always @ (*)
begin
    if(sel)
        y <= i1;
    else 
        y <= i0;
end
endmodule
```

###  **How It Works**

- **Inputs:** `i0`, `i1` (data), `sel` (select line)
- **Output:** `y` (registered output)
- **Logic:** If `sel` is 1, `y` gets `i1`; if `sel` is 0, `y` gets `i0`.
