## 1. What is a Simulator, Design, and Testbench?

## simulator

A simulator is a software tool that executes a design model along with its testbench to mimic the behavior of a digital circuit. It evaluates how the circuit responds over time by processing the input signals and applying the defined logic of the design.

In the context of Verilog, a Verilog simulator allows designers to:

---> Execute and verify the functionality of a Verilog design.

---> Test the design with a testbench before moving to actual hardware implementation.

---> Observe and debug the circuitâ€™s behavior in a safe, virtual environment.

In short, a simulator helps validate the correctness of a design at the RTL (Register Transfer Level) before it progresses to synthesis and physical design, saving both time and cost.


## Design

A design in Verilog is the hardware description (RTL code) that specifies how a digital circuit should work. It defines the structure and behavior of the circuit using modules, inputs, outputs, and logic.

## Testbench

A test bench is a simulation-only environment written in a Hardware Verification Language (HVL) like Verilog or SystemVerilog that applies input stimuli to a Design Under Test (DUT) and checks its output responses to verify the design's functional correctness.

## 2. Introduction to iverilog based flow


Here is an explanation of the iverilog-based simulation flow

* **Design & Test Bench:** The simulation process starts with two main inputs: the **design** (your Verilog code for the circuit you're creating) and the **test bench** (another Verilog module that generates input stimuli and checks the output of your design).
* **Icarus Verilog (iverilog):** These two files are compiled together by the **iverilog** compiler. Icarus Verilog is a free and open-source Verilog simulator. It takes the design and test bench files and creates a simulation executable.
* **VCD File Generation:** During the simulation, the iverilog executable generates a **VCD (Value Change Dump) file**. This file records all the signal changes over time in your simulation. It's a text-based format that logs when and to what value a signal changes.
* **GTKWave:** The VCD file, being a raw text log, isn't easy to read. You use a waveform viewer like **GTKWave** to open and visualize the data from the VCD file. GTKWave presents the signal changes as a graphical **waveform**, allowing you to see the timing relationships and values of all the signals in your design. * **Waveform Visualization:** The final output is the waveform display in GTKWave, which is crucial for debugging and verifying that your design behaves as expected according to the test bench stimuli.

Hereâ€™s the typical simulation flow image:

## 3. Install the Required Tools 
 
If installed already then no need this

```
sudo apt install iverilog
sudo apt install gtkwave
```


# 4. How to use GTKWave and Iverilog with a 2-to-1 Multiplexer example 

Letâ€™s simulate a simple **2-to-1 multiplexer** using iverilog and gtkwave.


###  Step 1: Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop.git

cd sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files

```

###  Step 2: Simulate the Design

Compile the design and testbench:

```
iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v
```


Run the simulation:

```
./a.out
```

View the waveform:

```
gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd
```


## 5. Verilog and test bench code analysis of the 2-to-1 Multiplexer

**The code for the multiplexer (`good_mux.v`):**

```verilog
module good_mux (input i0, input i1, input sel, output reg y);
always @ (*)
begin
    if(sel)
        y <= i1;
    else 
        y <= i0;
end
endmodule
```

###  **How It Works**

- **Inputs:** `i0`, `i1` (data), `sel` (select line)
- **Output:** `y` (registered output)
- **Logic:** If `sel` is 1, `y` gets `i1`; if `sel` is 0, `y` gets `i0`.


```Verilog with testbench
`timescale 1ns / 1ps
module tb_good_mux;
	// Inputs
	reg i0,i1,sel;
	// Outputs
	wire y;

        // Instantiate the Unit Under Test (UUT)
	good_mux uut (
		.sel(sel),
		.i0(i0),
		.i1(i1),
		.y(y)
	);

	initial begin
	$dumpfile("tb_good_mux.vcd");
	$dumpvars(0,tb_good_mux);
	// Initialize Inputs
	sel = 0;
	i0 = 0;
	i1 = 0;
	#300 $finish;
	end

always #75 sel = ~sel;
always #10 i0 = ~i0;
always #55 i1 = ~i1;
endmodule
```

## **How It Works**

- At t=0, all inputs (sel, i0, i1) = 0.

- Signals start toggling at their specified delays.

    * i0 â†’ fastest changing (every 10 ns).

    * i1 â†’ medium speed (every 55 ns).

    * sel â†’ slowest (every 75 ns).

- The DUT (good_mux) receives these inputs and produces output y accordingly.

- All changes are recorded in tb_good_mux.vcd, so you can open it in GTKWave and watch the waveforms.

- At t=300 ns, simulation ends.

## 6. Overview of Yosys and Setup Guide 

  Before introducing yosys tool, lets know about synthesizer.

### What is synthesizer?

  **Synthesizer** is a tool which converts RTL to gate-level netlist. Here, we are using yosys as a synthesizer tool.

###  What is Yosys?

**Yosys** is a powerful open-source synthesis tool for digital hardware. It takes your Verilog code and converts it into a gate-level netlistâ€”a hardware blueprint.

#### Yosys Features
```
--> Open-source logic synthesis tool for Verilog designs.

--> Supports RTL synthesis (Verilog â†’ gate-level netlist).

--> Provides technology mapping to standard cell libraries.

--> Performs optimization (area, timing, redundancy removal).

--> Supports formal verification (equivalence checking).

--> Can generate netlists in formats like BLIF, EDIF, JSON, etc.

--> Integrates with ABC tool for logic optimization and mapping.

--> Extensible with custom passes and plugins.

--> Widely used in OpenLANE and RTL-to-GDSII flows.

```

## Yosys tool setup

```
Inputs:

Verilog Design file â†’ read_verilog.

Library file (.lib) (defines standard cells) â†’ read_liberty.

Yosys processes them to perform logic synthesis.

Output: Netlist file â†’ written using write_verilog.

In short: Yosys takes design + library, runs synthesis, and generates a netlist.

```

Hereâ€™s the typical yosys setup image:



## Verify the Synthesis 

Note: Primary inputs/outputs donâ€™t change â†’ the same testbench can be reused.

```
Inputs: Netlist (from synthesis) + Testbench.

Both are given to iverilog (the simulator).

Output is a VCD file that shows waveforms.

Open in GTKWave to compare behavior.

Key point: If the synthesized netlist produces the same output as the RTL simulation â†’ synthesis is correct.


```

Hereâ€™s the typical verifying synthesis image:







## 7. Introduction to Synthesis and .lib

First, look at synthesis and then dive into gate libraries
 
### What is synthesis? 

```
 **synthesis** means that converting from one form of level to another form of level. 

```

 so, lets dive into what is logic synthesis?

 ## What is logic synthesis?

 **Logic synthesis** means that converting from RTLcode into optimized gate-level netlist w.r.t Performace, Power and Timing (PPA).

## What is .lib, and what are its contents?

## What is .lib?

 **.lib file** is a short of liberty timing file. It is an ASCII representation of timing, power parameter associated with cells inside the std cell library of a particular technology node.

## Contents of .lib

```
Cell definitions â†’ list of all standard cells (e.g., NAND2, NOR2, INV, DFF).

Pin information â†’ input/output pins, direction, function.

Timing data â†’ delay, setup, hold times, clock-to-Q, etc.

Power data â†’ dynamic and leakage power.

Constraints â†’ drive strength, fanout limits, load capacitance.

```
