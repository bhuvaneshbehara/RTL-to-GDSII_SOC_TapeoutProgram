Welcome to Day 1 of the RTL-to-GDSII SoC Tapeout Program! ðŸŽ‰

Today, your journey into VLSI design begins with a deep dive into simulation and synthesis using cutting-edge open-source tools.

```
ðŸ”¹ Youâ€™ll discover what an open-source simulator is and get hands-on with Icarus Verilog (iverilog) to simulate Verilog RTL designs.

ðŸ”¹ Youâ€™ll learn the fundamentals of logic synthesis, understanding how RTL transforms into gate-level logic.

ðŸ”¹ Finally, youâ€™ll roll up your sleeves and perform practical synthesis with Yosys, an open-source tool trusted by designers worldwide.

This is not just theoryâ€”itâ€™s about real, practical experience. By the end of the day, youâ€™ll have simulated and synthesized your own designs, taking the very first step toward a complete SoC tapeout. The journey starts hereâ€”letâ€™s make it count! ðŸš€âœ¨
