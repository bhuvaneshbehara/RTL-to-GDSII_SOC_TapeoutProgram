# Program Motto

```bash

---> Using open-source tools and open hardware (RISC-V), anybody may design and tape out a SoC.

---> Open-Source Driven â€“ Use of free and open-source EDA tools (Yosys, OpenSTA, Magic, Ngspice, OpenLane, etc.) so that chip design is accessible to everyone.

---> Hands-on Learning â€“ Provide a structured, step-by-step flow from RTL to GDSII where learners actually build and tapeout a chip.

---> RISC-V Based â€“ Leverage the open RISC-V ISA as a base processor core for SoC design, removing licensing barriers.

---> Tapeout Experience â€“ Not just theory, but a real silicon tapeout experience (getting from Verilog â†’ GDSII â†’ fabrication).

---> Community & Collaboration â€“ Build a global community of VLSI enthusiasts, students, and professionals who learn and contribute together.

---> Bridging Academia and Industry â€“ Equip learners with industry-grade flow knowledge using open-source tools, making them tapeout-ready engineers.
