```bash


 ---> Open-Source Tools: Driven by Open-Source Chip design is made available to anyone with the use of free and open-source EDA tools (Yosys, OpenSTA, Magic, Ngspice, OpenLane, etc.).

 ---> Hands-on Learning : Offer a methodical, sequential progression from RTL to GDSII in which students actually build and design a chip.

 ---> Tapeout Experience: Not just theory, but a real silicon tapeout experience (getting from Verilog → GDSII → fabrication).

 ---> Community & Collaboration: Create a global network of experts, students, and VLSI enthusiasts who share knowledge and work together.

 ---> Connecting Education and Industry: Using open-source technologies, give students industry-level flow expertise to make them engineers who are ready for tapeout.
