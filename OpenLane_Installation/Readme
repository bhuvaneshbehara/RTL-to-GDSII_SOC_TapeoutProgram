# OpenLane_Installation Steps

Before Installation steps, Lets start with what is Docker and Openlane.


# About **Docker and OpenLane**: 
      OpenLane is an open-source automated RTL-to-GDSII flow for VLSI design, and it is distributed through a Docker-based environment to ensure portability and reproducibility. By using Docker, users avoid dependency issues, as the entire toolchain (Yosys, OpenROAD, Magic, Netgen, etc.) is packaged within a container. This makes the setup process much simpler and guarantees consistency across different systems (Ubuntu, Windows WSL, macOS). Running OpenLane inside Docker ensures that designs can be built, tested, and verified in a controlled environment, making it easier for researchers, students, and engineers to contribute to and replicate results from the open-source silicon ecosystem.


# Steps to install Docker and OpenLane:

```bash

Steps to install Docker:

Set Up Docker Repository

sudo apt-get update 

sudo apt-get upgrade

sudo apt install -y build-essential python3 python3-venv python3-pip make git


# Add Docker's official repository:

```bash

echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo \"$VERSION_CODENAME\") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
